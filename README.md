# SymlinkGenerator

This is a Swift CLI for generating symlinks from a simple file, useful for bootstrapping a new machine.
I wrote this utility in a somewhat functional programming style just for kicks.

## Symlink file format

## Building

## How to use

## Compatibility
Currently only tested on macOS. However, I plan on testing it on Linux.
I believe XCTest does not run on Linux, so I am not sure about running unit tests on Linux ðŸ˜¢

## ToDos
* Rename to SymGen
* Make folders to path to be linked to if they do not exist
* Integrate into personal bootstrap flow
* Add `localizedDescription` property to SymGenError
* Write more tests
* Test built version on Rasbian
* Install Docker and test with compiling and such on virtualized instance of Ubuntu
